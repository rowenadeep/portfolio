	   <h3><i>Career Statement</i></h3>
	   I'm a junior web developer who is enthusiastic about tech. I was interested in this since I thought this was the best way to solve technical problems. I'm a sincere, trustworthy, commmited, ready to learn and problem solving person. I expect in three years time to have learnt all the programmming languages to become a full stack developer and in 5 years to be a well known software developer in the country.
	   <h3><i>My skills</i></h3>
	    I have been to learn three programming and one is still in progress. These are the languages:
	    <ul>
	 	<li>HTML <progress value="80" max="100"></progress></li><br/>

	   	<li>CSS <progress value="90" max="100"></progress><li><br/>

	    <li>Javascript <progress value="30" max="100"></progress></li><br>
	</ul>

       <h3><i> Tunapanda</i></h3>
       This is Tunapanda is for me (I value my opinions and thinking):
       It's an institution where learning takes place not just any learning but in tech, business and design plus a bonus of personal development. An alternative for our formal system of government. It has values for a great organisation: Respect counts each time between employees-employees and employers-employees, Collaboration-Working together to achieve  goal, Growth mindset, Innovation, Responsibility- Being accountable to one's work and to another This is the place of great innovation. Here, you will meet people with great minds wanting change the commmunity. Here you can learn about yourself more and reason withyourself about some things.
